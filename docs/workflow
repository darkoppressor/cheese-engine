Note that as I am the sole developer on this project, I am not doing pull requests.
However, if additional developers join the project, they should be used.

The branching model is essentially the one outlined here: https://githubflow.github.io/.

Pushing a branch to the remote repository triggers a build and deploy via Jenkins.

Tags are used to track commits tied to version updates (i.e., releases).

When an updated version has been pushed to main, tag the commit locally and remotely:

    git tag <VERSION>
    git push origin tag <VERSION>
