2D game engine for Windows, macOS, Linux, and Android

The Cheese Engine is the engine running Cheese and Bacon Games', uh, games.
It was developed in-house (literally, I don't have an office) by intrepid programmer Kevin Wells. That's me.
It is probably a horrible engine. It began years ago as a game written by me while I was still learning to write code.
This game was never completed. It did, however, become another game.
That game was completed, and it was called Hubert's Island Adventure: Mouse o' War. The title of the game was long.
Since that time, more projects and games were written with the same code, copy and pasted again and again.
Modifications were made, limbs were grafted on, pieces were removed.
Finally, to end the madness, I ripped all of the engine-specific stuff out of my most recent project and turned it into a software library.
That software library is the Cheese Engine. It is written in C++, with a little C and Java here and there.
Peruse the source code if you dare, but be warned: No one but me has ever used this for anything.
